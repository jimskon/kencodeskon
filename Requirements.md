**Cloud-Based Programming IDE for Computing Class**  
**Client Organization:** College Computing Department

---

# **1\. Introduction**

## **1.1 Purpose**

The purpose of this document is to outline the requirements for the development of a web-based Integrated Development Environment (IDE) tailored for a computing class. This IDE will provide a user-friendly platform for students and instructors to write, execute, and collaborate on code efficiently. The system will integrate various programming features such as real-time collaboration, GitHub integration, and automated testing.

## **1.2 Scope**

The IDE will include the following functionalities:

* Code editing and execution.  
* User authentication (Login/Signup).  
* Project creation, saving, and execution.  
* Error feedback and debugging messages.  
* Real-time collaboration, including screen sharing and pair programming.  
* GitHub integration for saving, loading, and managing repositories.  
* A programming challenges module with automated testing and submissions.

This project will be developed over a semester by a team of students in collaboration with computing faculty.

## **1.3 Glossary**

* IDE (Integrated Development Environment): A software platform that provides tools for writing and testing code.  
* GitHub: A cloud-based platform for version control and source code management.  
* Authentication: The process of verifying user identity.  
* Containerized Workspaces: Isolated development environments that ensure consistency across setups.  
* OAuth: An open standard for secure user authentication.
